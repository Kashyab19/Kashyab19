Yo ðŸ‘‹ 

ðŸŽ§ I am currently practicing LeetCode and learning how DeFi works. I am trying to learn how AI agents work as well!

A bit about me with a background in Software Engineering and DevOps:
1. Founding Engineer for Easy Summaries: We built a Chrome Extension that lets you summarize web articles and videos(currently at 250 users). https://x.com/EasySummaries
2. Full-stack Intern, Blockchain at G2W Consulting: I built a prototype for a healthcare-based web3 app that helps patients auction their service requests to hospitals in the network.
3. Full-stack developer at Verizon: I was responsible for building the receiptsâ€™ business logic for nearly 140M customers(Funny note: I wasnâ€™t accountable if anyone got their bill high)
4. Active Hackathon Participant: I participate in hackathons regularly to learn more about new tools and meet with new people(won four hackathons at Harvard)!
5. I am Boston-based and open to moving
