### Intro

Hi,

I am currently one of the Founding Engineers @ [Tradible](https://tradible.io). When I'm not coding, you'll find me writing blogs on [Substack](https://kashyabnarrates.substack.com/) about things I find curious, or doing a Deep Research using LLMs to learn about a topic in finance, system design, or a random subject.

### Past works
1. Software Engineer @ Verizon - I was responsible for building the Billing Service to cater to nearly 140M customers (Stack: Spring Boot, Kibana, AWS S3)
2. Founding Engineer @ [Easy Summaries](https://www.summerize.ai/) - Designed and built an AI-powered Chrome Extension to summarize web articles in one click (Stack: JavaScript, Node JS, DynamoDB)
