Hi ðŸ‘‹ [Open to work in the USA] 

ðŸŽ§ I am currently practicing leetcode and learning cloud!

A bit about me with a background in Software Engineering and DevOps:
1. Founding Engineer for Easy Summaries: We built a Chrome Extension that lets you summarize web articles and videos(currently at 250 users).
2. Blockchain Intern(solo dev) at G2W Consulting: I built a prototype for a healthcare-based web3 app that helps patients auction their service requests to hospitals in the network.
3. Full-stack developer at Verizon: I was responsible for building the receiptsâ€™ business logic for nearly 140M customers(Funny note: I wasnâ€™t accountable if anyone got their bill high)
4. Active Hackathon Participant: I participate in hackathons regularly to learn more about new tools and meet with new people(won four hackathons at Harvard)!
5. I am Boston-based and open to moving (and browsing through YC and a16z companies is one of my interests).
